# Servo-Based-Distance-Scanning-with-Arduino-and-Ultrasonic-Sensor
An Arduino project using a servo motor and ultrasonic sensor to measure distances and scan the environment. The servo rotates, allowing the ultrasonic sensor to capture distance data at various angles, with output displayed on the Serial Monitor. Perfect for proximity detection and environmental mapping applications.
